Abstract
========

This study investigates the efficacy of audit filters in identifying opportunities for improvement in trauma care, aiming to enhance the quality of healthcare delivery. Trauma care is a critical aspect of healthcare, and continuous quality assessment is imperative for optimizing patient outcomes. Audit filters, defined as systematic criteria applied to healthcare data to identify potential areas of improvement, have emerged as valuable tools in this endeavor.

Using a the Swedish national trauma registry, SweTrau, this research assesses the performance of 10 individual audit filters in predicting opportunities for improvement. The study employs a multi-faceted approach, combining quantitative analysis of historical trauma care data with qualitative insights from healthcare professionals to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

Preliminary findings suggest that audit filters exhibit promising performance in identifying key areas where enhancements in trauma care are warranted. The study evaluates the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of different audit filters, shedding light on their ability to pinpoint both systemic and case-specific opportunities for improvement. Moreover, the research explores the practical implications of implementing these filters in real-world healthcare settings.

The results contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on trauma care quality improvement, providing healthcare administrators and practitioners with evidence-based guidance on leveraging audit filters effectively. By identifying opportunities for enhancement, these filters empower healthcare providers to proactively address deficiencies, ultimately fostering a culture of continuous improvement in trauma care.

In conclusion, this study not only advances our understanding of the applicability of audit filters in trauma care but also offers a foundation for future research and practical implementation. The integration of audit filters into routine quality assessment processes holds significant promise for elevating the standard of trauma care and, consequently, improving patient outcomes in diverse healthcare settings.

You can include code in this document like this:

```{r main, echo=FALSE}
source("main.R") ## This "imports" the main script file of your project and run any code in it
```

You can also embed plots:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

You can also mix text and code, so called inline code, like this: `r 2+5`.
