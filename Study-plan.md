Introduction
============
This is a study plan.
Trauma, a physical injury of external origin together with the body's associated response constitutes 9% of global deaths each year. [@world2014injuries]

Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and time-critical provision of healthcare and is therefore prone to errors [@Ghorbani2018Analysis] that could have detrimental consequences. Trauma care often constitutes of anesthesiologists, different surgical specialities, Emergency physicians and nurses. 

In order to minimize furthermore foresee such errors, Quality improvement (QI) programs have been established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC). These programs have become a core part in the trauma process and its development all around the world.  
  QI programs consist of a set of recommended techniques that seek to enable discussion and analysis of the trauma process in order to take corrective measures for future success. Without conversing little change ought to happen, which is why morbidity and mortality conferences (M&M), also known as "death and complications conferences", are a central part in QI techniques. They involve a conversation between individuals from different disciplines involved in the trauma care process about reported deaths and complications in selected patient cases. During the conferences, a preventable death panel determines whether the death of a patient or a complication could have been preventable. When effectively implemented M&M, serves as a crucial fault-examining tool. They can transform such faults from being solely negative marks against individual care providers into incentives for reporting. These conferences promote a broader, system-based approach that emphasizes the analysis of tasks, teamwork, and quality improvement.[@Lazzara2019morbidity]

A technique that IQ programs avail is filtering certain factors that deviate from standard care, such factors are labeled as audit filters (also known as quality indicators).
Audit filters are factors that deviate from standard care and are used to filter out certain problems. An audit filter could be death, the placement of 2 large bore intravenous lines within 15 minutes from arrival to a healthcare facility, etc. [@world2009guidelines]
What is known/not known?

[@Pedro2007Preventable] Analysed the deaths of all trauma patients during a period of 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) at two mature Trauma Level I centers, The Los Angeles County (LAC) and The University of Southern California (USC). Weekly Morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences followed by multidisciplinary conferences were then held in order to examine the cause of death by categorizing them into preventable, potentially preventable, and non-preventable. They found that 2,5% of deaths were classified as either preventable (0,53%) or potentially preventable (1,92%).
A similar study [@Ghorbani2018Analysis] at Karolinska University Hospital, also a trauma level-I center was made where a Multidisciplinary peer review committee (MPRC) reviewed the deaths of trauma patients within 30 days of admission during a period of 4 years (April 2012 to March 2016). They came to the conclusion that (0.4%) of deaths were classified as preventable and (3.6%) were classified as potentially preventable. 

[@chadbunchachai2001comparative] made use of 32 audit filters in order to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mortality and preventable deaths. The use of audit filters showed decreases in mortality (2.6% vs. 2.4%) and preventable death (3.0% vs. 2.0%).
[@Evans09] sought to determine if audit filters could be used in improving processes of trauma care. They reviewed that None of the studies that met the inclusion criteria. This means that there is still a gap. 
Knowledge gap?
Why is it important?
Trauma is a great burden globally and costs alot for society 

*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.*

*bmcemerg.csl is a citation style language file that governs how
citations and the reference list will be formatted. Leave as it is.*
