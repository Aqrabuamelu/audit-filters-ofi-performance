# Introduction #

## Definition ##

Trauma, a physical injury of external origin together with the body's associated response constitutes 9% of global deaths each year. [@world2014injuries] It is the leading cause of death for individuals between the ages 10 to 49[@vos2020global]. Trauma Is categorized broadly into two groups by underlying mechanism: Penetrating and blunt trauma. Bullet wounds and knife cuts are common examples of penetrating trauma. Blunt trauma is attributed to injuries like road injuries and falls which are not sharp in nature. Generally speaking, blunt trauma is caused by high-force impact over a larger surface area compared to penetrating trauma where that force is applied to a smaller surface area causing greater pressure thus acting in a piercing manner often resulting in deeper lacerations to tissues and organs. Blunt trauma with enough force can however be penetrating in character[@hexdall2011Mechanism]. In Sweden, road traffic incidence and falls are at the top of the list of mechanisms of injury accounting for around 80% of injuries[@SweTrau2022Ã…rsrapport].

## Severity of Injury ##

When categorizing trauma with the intention to treat we use severity as measurement. However, since injuries can vary in so many ways and are categorized in so many ways it is important to categorise trauma with the intention to treat it. For this reason,since 1975, it is common practice to use the severity of the injury as a means to triage patient cases thus approaching the problem in a more effective way by improving the ability to evaluate care of the injured.[@baker1974injury] 

## Impact ##

Injuries are not only a burden to the afflicted individual but also to a greater extent to society as a whole. There have been attempts to estimate the global cost of injury. It is however estimated that road injuries alone account for 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in high-income countries[@world2014injuries].

## Trauma care ##

In order to effectively treat trauma patients in regards to its specific nature and characteristics a special subdivision of healthcare, trauma care, is used. Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and time-critical provision of healthcare. It uses a myriad of different specialties including but not limited to surgeons, anesthesiologists, emergency doctors and nurses. Because of its complexity and sensitivity to delay it is prone to errors that could have detrimental consequences [@Ghorbani2018Analysis].

## Quality improvement ##

In order to minimize furthermore foresee such errors, Quality improvement (QI) programs have been established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC). These programs have become a core part of the trauma process and its development all around the world.  

QI programs consist of a set of recommended techniques that seek to enable discussion and analysis of the trauma process in order to take corrective measures for future success. Without conversing, little change ought to happen, which is why morbidity and mortality conferences (M&M), also known as "death and complications conferences", are a central part of QI techniques. It is however a method which has been around in the healthcare community since 1904, the year that  Dr. Ernest Amory Codman brought forward the importance of physician accountability in healthcare settings. Since then M&M has made itself deeply rooted in universal healthcare and developed into an established framework of crucial components of anonymity, a focus on specific adverse events, realising flawed approaches, critical analysis and lastly the effort to change and practice that change. [@Alexander2016Morbidity]

They have shown great results in reducing mortality. [@O'Reilly2013Opportunities] 

### Morbidity and mortality conferences ###

The M&M conferences are regularly scheduled meetings in which specific patient cases are brought up and discussed between healthcare professionals from all the different disciplines involved in trauma care and its processes. It is recommended that they are held for around 40 minutes but this varies between different hospitals.[@world2009guidelines] During the conferences, a preventable death panel determines whether the death of a patient or a complication could have been preventable. When effectively implemented M&M, serves as a crucial fault-examining tool. They can transform such faults from being solely negative marks against individual care providers into incentives for reporting. These conferences promote a broader, system-based approach that emphasizes the analysis of tasks, teamwork, and quality improvement.[@Lazzara2019morbidity]

### Audit filters ###

Another technique that IQ programs offer is the use of audit filters (also known as quality indicators). Audit filters are specific established criteria involved in trauma processes and care. It is used to detect deviation from standardized care in order to further analyze the cause behind complications in Trauma patients. Examples of audit filters are death, the placement of 2 large bore intravenous lines within 15 minutes from arrival to a healthcare facility, etc. [@world2009guidelines]

### Opportunities for improvement ###

## Knowledge Gap ##

[@Pedro2007Preventable] Analysed the deaths of all trauma patients during a period of 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) at two mature Trauma Level I centers, The Los Angeles County (LAC) and The University of Southern California (USC). Weekly Morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences followed by multidisciplinary conferences were then held in order to examine the cause of death by categorizing them into preventable, potentially preventable, and non-preventable. They found that 2,5% of deaths were classified as either preventable (0,53%) or potentially preventable (1,92%).
A similar study [@Ghorbani2018Analysis] at Karolinska University Hospital, also a trauma level-I center was made where a Multidisciplinary peer review committee (MPRC) reviewed the deaths of trauma patients within 30 days of admission during a period of 4 years (April 2012 to March 2016). They came to the conclusion that (0.4%) of deaths were classified as preventable and (3.6%) were classified as potentially preventable. 

[@chadbunchachai2001comparative] made use of 32 audit filters in order to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mortality and preventable deaths. The use of audit filters showed decreases in mortality (2.6% vs. 2.4%) and preventable death (3.0% vs. 2.0%).

[@Evans09] sought to determine if audit filters could be used in improving processes of trauma care. They reviewed that None of the studies that met the inclusion criteria. This means that there is still a gap. 

It seems as if certain audit filters do not associate with OFIs. [@lewis2017delay]

## Aim ##

Trauma is a great burden globally and contribute to large economical costs for society, which is why OFIs are of such importance in trauma care development. While audit filters are good indicators of standard care, it is crucial to determine wheter audit filters are of high value as a tool for predicting OFIs. 

# Methods #

Study design 4 Present key elements of study design early in the paper
This is a registry-based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about 12000 patients treated between 2012 and 2022. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 6000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2022. The outcome is opportunities for improvement, as identified by the multidisciplinary review board and recorded in the trauma care quality database. Data on the audit filters are available in the trauma registry. This project will link the two databases and assess the performance of each audit filter in terms of discrimination and accuracy. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence level will be used.

## Study setting and population ##

Karolinska University Hospital is classified as a Trauma level I hospital. Every year around 1500 patients receive treatment at the hospital. If a patient case results in team activation it is added to the Karolinska trauma registry. If no team activation occurred but the patient had ISS>9 retrospectively it is also included in the registry. The Karolinska trauma registry is a subset of the national registry, the Swedish Trauma registry (SweTrau). The registry includes data on vital signs, times, injuries, and interventions as well as patient demographics according to the European consensus statement, the Utstein template   

Karolinska trauma registry also contains a care quality database which contains specific audit filters and OFIs that are determined in M&M conferences through consensus decision. M&M conferences are attended by all professionals involved in trauma care. surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedics, anesthesiologists, nurses, and radiologists.

This process of determining OFIs unfolds in multiple stages, characterized by escalating levels of scrutiny. Notably, instances of mortality are directly referred to the multidisciplinary conference, where, in addition to assessing OFIs, a determination is made regarding whether the fatality was preventable or potentially preventable, a classification also falling under the purview of OFIs.

From 2014 to 2017 there was an effort put forward in identifying adverse outcomes which where unrelated to mortality, the review process underwent subsequent refinement and formalization during the study period. During this period each trauma patient case underwent individual assessments by a specialized trauma nurse in order to identify potential OFIs. It was, however not until 2017 in which this procedure was formalized and it became standardized to incorporate a prelimanary individual evaluation by a specialized trauma nurse upon data registration in the trauma registry and the trauma quality database.
The trauma quality data underwent screening via audit filters, and all cases falling outside the criteria delineated by these filters, along with those trauma patients flagged by the nurse during the initial review for possible care failures, were subjected to a secondary review by two specialized nurses. Subsequent identification of a potential OFI during this second review prompted a comprehensive evaluation of the respective trauma patient's case.

## eligibility criteria ##

In this study, we included all. who underwent screening for OFIs derived from both the trauma registry and the trauma care quality database during the period spanning from 2014 to 2021. Exclusion criteria were applied to individuals under the age of 15, as their clinical management process has notable distinctions compared to those applicable to the adult population.
