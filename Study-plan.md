Introduction
============
This is a study plan.
Trauma, a physical injury of external origin together with the body's associated response constitutes 9% of global deaths each year. [@world2014injuries]

WHY? EXAMPLES of trauma

Trauma care is a multidisciplinary (?), complex (?), and time-critical (?) provision of healthcare and is therefore prone to errors (?) that could have detrimental 
consequences. WHAT CONSEQUENSES?

In order to minimize furthermore foresee such errors, Quality improvement (IQ) programs have been established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC).

About these programs?

A technique that IQ programs avail is filtering certain factors that deviate from standard care, such factors are labeled as audit filters (also known as quality indicators).
Audit filters are factors that deviate from standard care and are used to filter out certain problems. An audit filter could be death, the placement of 2 large bore intravenous lines within 15 minutes from arrival to a healthcare facility, etc. [@world2009guidelines]
What is known/not known?

[@Pedro2007Preventable] Analysed the deaths of all trauma patients during a period of 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) at two mature Trauma Level I centers, The Los Angeles County (LAC) and The University of Southern California (USC). Weekly Morbidity & Mortality (M&M) conferences followed by multidisciplinary conferences where then held in order to examine the cause of death followed by categorising them into preventable, potentially preventable and non-preventable. They found that 2,5% of deaths where classified as either preventable (0,53%) or potentially preventable (1,92%).

[@chadbunchachai2001comparative] made use of 32 audit filters in order to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mortality and preventable deaths. The use of audit filters showed decreases in mortality (2.6% vs. 2.4%) and preventable death (3.0% vs. 2.0%).
[@Evans09] sought to determine if audit filters could be used in improving processes of trauma care. They reviewed over None of the studies met the inclusion criteria. This means that there is still 
a gap. 
Knowledge gap?
Why is it important?
Trauma is a great burden globally and costs alot for society 

*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.*

*bibliography.bib includes an example reference. Add additional
references in that file as bibtex entries and cite as

*bmcemerg.csl is a citation style language file that governs how
citations and the reference list will be formatted. Leave as it is.*
