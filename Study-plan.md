# Introduction

Trauma, a physical injury of external origin together with the body's
associated response constitutes 9% of global deaths each year.
[@world2014injuries] It is the leading cause of death for individuals
between the ages 10 to 49[@vos2020global],[@roth2018global]. Trauma Is categorized broadly
into two groups by underlying mechanism: Penetrating and blunt trauma.
Bullet wounds and knife cuts are common examples of penetrating trauma.
Blunt trauma is attributed to injuries like road injuries and falls
which are not sharp in nature. Generally speaking, blunt trauma is
caused by high-force impact over a larger surface area compared to
penetrating trauma where that force is applied to a smaller surface area
causing greater pressure thus acting in a piercing manner often
resulting in deeper lacerations to tissues and organs. Blunt trauma with
enough force can however be penetrating in
character[@hexdall2011Mechanism]. In Sweden, road traffic incidence and
falls are at the top of the list of mechanisms of injury accounting for
around 80% of injuries[@SweTrau2022Arsrapport].

## Impact

Injuries are not only a burden to the afflicted individual but also to a
greater extent to society as a whole. One aspect of such societal effects are economic costs. There have been attempts to
estimate the global cost of injury but due to its complexity it is not an easy task. It is however estimated that road
injuries alone account for 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in
high-income countries[@world2014injuries].

## Trauma care systems

In order to effectively treat trauma patients in regards to its specific
nature and complexity a special subdivision of healthcare, trauma
care, is used. Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and
time-critical provision of healthcare delivered by specialized trauma centers. It uses a myriad of different
specialties including but not limited to surgeons, anesthesiologists,
emergency doctors and nurses. Because of its complexity and sensitivity
to delay it is prone to errors that could have detrimental consequences
[@ghorbani2018analysis].

## Quality improvement

In order to minimize furthermore foresee such errors, Quality
improvement (QI) programs have been established by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery
and Intensive Care (IATSIC). These programs have become a core part of
the trauma process and its development all around the world [@world2009guidelines].

QI programs consist of a set of recommended techniques that seek to
enable discussion and analysis of the trauma process in order to take
corrective measures for future success. 

They have shown great results in reducing mortality with the implementation of quality improvement programs.
[@o2013opportunities]

### Morbidity and mortality conferences - A cornerstone in functioning QI programmes

Morbidity and mortality conferences (M&M), also known as "death and complications conferences", are a
central part of QI techniques. It is however a method which has been
around in the healthcare community since 1904, the year that Dr. Ernest
Amory Codman brought forward the importance of physician accountability
in healthcare settings. Since then M&M has made itself deeply rooted in
universal healthcare and developed into an established framework of
crucial components of anonymity, a focus on specific adverse events,
realising flawed approaches, critical analysis and lastly the effort to
change and practice that change. [@gregor2016morbidity]

The M&M conferences are regularly scheduled meetings in which specific
patient cases are brought up and discussed between healthcare
professionals from all the different disciplines involved in trauma care
and its processes. It is recommended that they are held for around 40
minutes but this varies between different
hospitals.[@world2009guidelines] During the conferences, a preventable
death panel determines whether the death of a patient or a complication
could have been preventable. When effectively implemented M&M, serves as
a crucial fault-examining tool. They can transform such faults from
being solely negative marks against individual care providers into
incentives for reporting. These conferences promote a broader,
system-based approach that emphasizes the analysis of tasks, teamwork,
and quality improvement.[@lazzara2022morbidity]

### Audit filters and Opportunities for improvement

Another technique that IQ programs offer is the use of audit filters
(also known as quality indicators). Audit filters are specific
established criteria involved in trauma processes and care. It is used
to detect deviation from standardized care in order to further analyze
the cause behind complications in Trauma patients. Examples of audit
filters are death, the placement of 2 large bore intravenous lines
within 15 minutes from arrival to a healthcare facility, etc.
[@world2009guidelines]. Audit filters have shown to be effective in reducing mortality after its implementation in some hospitals [@chadbunchachai2001comparative]. In 2009 there was an extensive review made that sought to determine if audit filters could be used in improving processes of trauma care however none of the studies met established inclusion criteria.[@evans2009audit]
The use of audit filters have also been associated with high frequencies of false positives, ranging from 24% to 80%.[@sanddal2011analysis], [@roy2017learning], [@ghorbani2018analysis]. Some audit filters seem to not correlate with OFIs at all [@lewis2017delay]

Opportunities for improvement (OFI) is the endpoint and aim of M&M conferences. Following the review of individual patient cases there is a consensus decision made regarding the existence of an OFI. It has been shown that such review process is associated with high-qualty trauma care. [@santana2014development]
OFIs have shown failures in initial care [@vioque2014classifying], specifically in airway management, fluid resucitation, hemorrhage control and chest injury management [@sanddal2011analysis], [@roy2017learning], [@o2013opportunities]. 

## Aim

Trauma is a great burden globally and contribute to large economical
costs for society, which is why OFIs are of such importance in trauma
care development. While audit filters are good indicators of standard
care, it is crucial to determine whether audit filters are of high value
as a tool for predicting OFIs.

# Methods

This is a registry-based cohort study that uses data from the trauma
registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University
Hospital in Solna in order to evaluate the performance of individual audit filters in predicting OFIs.

## Study setting and population

Karolinska University Hospital is classified as a Trauma level I
hospital. Every year around 1500 patients receive treatment at the
hospital. If a patient case results in team activation it is added to
the Karolinska trauma registry. If no team activation occurred but the
patient had ISS\>9 retrospectively it is also included in the registry.
The Karolinska trauma registry is a subset of the national registry, the
Swedish Trauma registry (SweTrau). The registry includes data on vital
signs, times, injuries, and interventions as well as patient
demographics according to the European consensus statement, the Utstein
template

Karolinska trauma registry also contains a care quality database which
contains specific audit filters and OFIs that are determined in M&M
conferences through consensus decision. M&M conferences are attended by
all professionals involved in trauma care. surgeons, neurosurgeons,
orthopedics, anesthesiologists, nurses, and radiologists.

This process of determining OFIs unfolds in multiple stages,
characterized by escalating levels of scrutiny. Notably, instances of
mortality are directly referred to the multidisciplinary conference,
where, in addition to assessing OFIs, a determination is made regarding
whether the death was preventable or potentially preventable, a
classification also falling under the purview of OFIs.

From 2013 to 2017 there was an effort put forward in identifying adverse
outcomes which where unrelated to mortality, the review process
underwent subsequent refinement and formalization during the study
period. During this period each trauma patient case underwent individual
assessments by a specialized trauma nurse in order to identify potential
OFIs. It was, however not until 2017 in which this procedure was
formalized and it became standardized to incorporate a prelimanary
individual evaluation by a specialized trauma nurse upon data
registration in the trauma registry and the trauma quality database. The
trauma quality data underwent screening via audit filters, and all cases
falling outside the criteria delineated by these filters, along with
those trauma patients flagged by the nurse during the initial review for
possible care failures, were subjected to a secondary review by two
specialized nurses. Subsequent identification of a potential OFI during
this second review prompted a comprehensive evaluation of the respective
trauma patient's case.

## eligibility criteria

In this study, we included all who underwent screening for OFIs derived
from both the trauma registry and the trauma care quality database
during the period spanning from 2013 to 2022. Exclusion criteria were
applied to individuals under the age of 15, as their clinical management
process has notable distinctions compared to those applicable to the
adult population.

## Variables

### Outcome

The outcome variable in this study is an OFI, as established by the M&M
conference through unanimous decision and furthermore valued as a binary
variable with "Yes - At least one OFI identified" and "No - No OFI
identified". This project will link the two
databases and assess the performance of each audit filter in terms of
discrimination and accuracy. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence
level will be used. 

### Exposures

The exposure variable is the audit filters.

### Predictors

## Data sources/measurement

To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each individual audit filter in predicting an OFI a mathematical equation is used:

True Positive (TP): Patient cases labeled with the specific audit filter and also show an OFI.

False Negative (FN): Patient cases labeled with the specific audit filter but show no OFI.

False Positive (FP): Patient cases not labeled with the specific audit filter but show an OFI.

True Negative (TN): Patient cases not labeled with the specific audit filter and also show no OFI.

The sensitivity is calculated accordingly: TP / (TP + FN) 

The specificity is calculated accordingly: TN / (TN + FP)

## Bias

The study results are generated by statistical analytics methods with the help of the statistical programming language, R. [@R2022language]. The data is already gathered thus there will be no bias in this study. 

## Study size

The study cohort encompasses all eligible patients treated at the hospital from 2012 to 2022.
