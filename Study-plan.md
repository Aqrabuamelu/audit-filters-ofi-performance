Introduction
============
This is a study plan.
Trauma, a physical injury of external origin together with the body's associated response constitutes 9% of global deaths each year. [@world2014injuries] It is the leading cause of death for individuals between the ages 10 to 49.[@vos2020global]. Trauma Is categorized broadly into three groups: Penetrating, blunt and deceleration trauma.  

Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and time-critical provision of healthcare and is therefore prone to errors [@Ghorbani2018Analysis] that could have detrimental consequences. Trauma care often consists of anesthesiologists, different surgical specialties, Emergency physicians, and nurses. 

In order to minimize furthermore foresee such errors, Quality improvement (QI) programs have been established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC). These programs have become a core part of the trauma process and its development all around the world. They have shown great results in reducing mortality. [@O'Reilly2013Opportunities] showed that implementation of quality improvement systems was associated with a reduction in mortality.  

QI programs consist of a set of recommended techniques that seek to enable discussion and analysis of the trauma process in order to take corrective measures for future success. Without conversing, little change ought to happen, which is why morbidity and mortality conferences (M&M), also known as "death and complications conferences", are a central part of QI techniques. It is however a method which has been around in the healthcare community since 1904, the year that  Dr. Ernest Amory Codman brought forward the importance of physician accountability in healthcare settings. Since then M&M has made itself deeply rooted in universal healthcare and developed into an established framework of crucial components of anonymity, a focus on specific adverse events, realising flawed approaches, critical analysis and lastly the effort to change and practice that change. [@Alexander2016Morbidity]

The M&M conferences are regularly scheduled meetings in which specific patient cases are brought up and discussed between healthcare professionals from all the different disciplines involved in trauma care and its processes. It is recommended that they are held for around 40 minutes but this varies between different hospitals.[@world2009guidelines]

During the conferences, a preventable death panel determines whether the death of a patient or a complication could have been preventable. When effectively implemented M&M, serves as a crucial fault-examining tool. They can transform such faults from being solely negative marks against individual care providers into incentives for reporting. These conferences promote a broader, system-based approach that emphasizes the analysis of tasks, teamwork, and quality improvement.[@Lazzara2019morbidity]

Another technique that IQ programs avail is audit filters (also known as quality indicators). Audit filters are certain established criteria involved in trauma processes and care. It is used to detect deviation from standardized care in order to further analyze the cause behind complications in Trauma patients. Examples of audit filters are death, the placement of 2 large bore intravenous lines within 15 minutes from arrival to a healthcare facility, etc. [@world2009guidelines]

[@Pedro2007Preventable] Analysed the deaths of all trauma patients during a period of 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) at two mature Trauma Level I centers, The Los Angeles County (LAC) and The University of Southern California (USC). Weekly Morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences followed by multidisciplinary conferences were then held in order to examine the cause of death by categorizing them into preventable, potentially preventable, and non-preventable. They found that 2,5% of deaths were classified as either preventable (0,53%) or potentially preventable (1,92%).
A similar study [@Ghorbani2018Analysis] at Karolinska University Hospital, also a trauma level-I center was made where a Multidisciplinary peer review committee (MPRC) reviewed the deaths of trauma patients within 30 days of admission during a period of 4 years (April 2012 to March 2016). They came to the conclusion that (0.4%) of deaths were classified as preventable and (3.6%) were classified as potentially preventable. 

[@chadbunchachai2001comparative] made use of 32 audit filters in order to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mortality and preventable deaths. The use of audit filters showed decreases in mortality (2.6% vs. 2.4%) and preventable death (3.0% vs. 2.0%).

[@Evans09] sought to determine if audit filters could be used in improving processes of trauma care. They reviewed that None of the studies that met the inclusion criteria. This means that there is still a gap. 

It seems as if certain audit filters do not associate with OFIs. [@lewis2017delay]
Trauma is a great burden globally and costs a lot for society, which is why OFIs are of such importance in trauma care development. And while audit filters are good indicators of standard care, it is crucial that it

There have been promising studies showing a reduction in preventable deaths after the use of audit filters in the clinical practice. However, it is still not known how good audit filters are as a tool for identifying OFIs 

Methods
=======

Study design 4 Present key elements of study design early in the paper
This is a registry-based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about 12000 patients treated between 2012 and 2022. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 6000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2022. The outcome is opportunities for improvement, as identified by the multidisciplinary review board and recorded in the trauma care quality database. Data on the audit filters are available in the trauma registry. This project will link the two databases and assess the performance of each audit filter in terms of discrimination and accuracy. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence level will be used.

Study setting and population
=======
Setting 5 Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment,

Karolinska University Hospital is classified as a Trauma level I hospital. Every year around 1500 patients receive treatment at the hospital. If a patient case results in team activation it is added to the Karolinska trauma registry. If no team activation occurred but the patient had ISS>9 retrospectively it is also included in the registry. The Karolinska trauma registry is a subset of the national registry, the Swedish Trauma registry (SweTrau).    

Karolinska trauma registry also contains a care quality database which contains specific audit filters and OFIs that are determined in M&M conferences

M&M conferences are attended by all professionals involved in trauma care. surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedics, anesthesiologists, nurses, and radiologists. 
exposure, follow-up, and data collection
(a) Give the eligibility criteria and the sources and methods of selection of
participants. Describe methods of follow-up

eligibility criteria
======
In this study, we included all. who underwent screening for OFIs derived from both the trauma registry and the trauma care quality database during the period spanning from 2014 to 2021. Exclusion criteria were applied to individuals under the age of 15, as their clinical management process has notable distinctions compared to those applicable to the adult population.

Variables
======
Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect
modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable

Participants
======
(b) For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number of exposed and
unexposed

Data sources/measurement
======
For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of
