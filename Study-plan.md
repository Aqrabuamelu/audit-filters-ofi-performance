Introduction
============
this is a study plan
Trauma, a physical injury of external origin together with the body's associated response constitutes 9% of global deaths each year. [@world2014injuries]
Trauma care is a multidisciplinary, complex, and time-critical provision of healthcare and is therefore prone to errors that could have detrimental 
consequences. In order to minimize furthermore foresee such errors, Quality improvement (IQ) programs have been established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC). A technique that IQ programs avail is filtering certain factors that deviate from standard care, such factors are labeled as Audit filters (also known as quality indicators).
Audit filters are factors that deviate from standard care and are used to filter out certain problems. An audit filter could be death, GCS score, etc. [@world2009guidelines]
What is known/not known?
[@Evans09] sought to determine if audit filters could be used in improving processes of trauma care. None of the studies met the inclusion criteria. This means that there is still 
a gap. 
Knowledge gap?
Why is it important?
Trauma is a great burden globally and costs alot for society 

*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.*

*bibliography.bib includes an example reference. Add additional
references in that file as bibtex entries and cite as
[@Courvoisier2011].*

*bmcemerg.csl is a citation style language file that governs how
citations and the reference list will be formatted. Leave as it is.*
