  ABSTRACT = {Trauma is a significant public health issue worldwide, particularly affecting economically active age groups.  Quality management of trauma care at the national level is crucial to improve outcomes of major trauma. In Korea, a biennial nationwide survey on preventable trauma death rate is conducted. Based on the survey results, we analyzed opportunities for improving the trauma treatment process. Expert panels reviewed records of 8282 and 8482 trauma-related deaths in 2017 and 2019, respectively, identifying 258 and 160 cases in each year as preventable deaths. Opportunities for improvement were categorized into prehospital, interhospital, and hospital stages. Hemorrhage was the primary cause of death, followed by sepsis/multiorgan failure and central nervous system injury. Delayed hemostatic procedures and transfusions were common areas for improvement in hospital stage. Interhospital transfers experienced significant delays in arrival time. This study emphasizes the need to enhance trauma care by refining treatment techniques, centralizing patients in specialized facilities, and implementing comprehensive reviews and performance improvements throughout the patient transfer system. The findings offer valuable insights for addressing trauma care improvement from both clinical and systemic perspectives.},
