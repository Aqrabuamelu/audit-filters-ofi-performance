[@chadbunchachai2001comparative] made use of 32 audit filters in order
to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mortality and preventable
deaths. The use of audit filters showed decreases in mortality (2.6% vs.
2.4%) and preventable death (3.0% vs. 2.0%).
[@teixeira2007preventable] Analysed the deaths of all trauma patients
during a period of 8 years (January 1998 to December 2005) at two mature
Trauma Level I centers, The Los Angeles County (LAC) and The University
of Southern California (USC). Weekly Morbidity and mortality (M&M)
conferences followed by multidisciplinary conferences were then held in
order to examine the cause of death by categorizing them into
preventable, potentially preventable, and non-preventable. They found
that 2,5% of deaths were classified as either preventable (0,53%) or
potentially preventable (1,92%). A similar study [@Ghorbani2018Analysis]
at Karolinska University Hospital, also a trauma level-I center was made
where a Multidisciplinary peer review committee (MPRC) reviewed the
deaths of trauma patients within 30 days of admission during a period of
4 years (April 2012 to March 2016). They came to the conclusion that
(0.4%) of deaths were classified as preventable and (3.6%) were
classified as potentially preventable.
