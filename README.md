# Performance of individual audit filters in predicting opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients

This repository documents our research project on the performance of individual audit filters in predicting opportunities for improvement in adult trauma patients.

## Summary

### Introduction

Trauma, the clinical entity composed of physical injury and the bodyâ€™s associated response, is a
leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. A cornerstone of trauma quality
improvement programs is multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity review to identify
opportunities for improvement and implement corrective actions. Examples of opportunities for
improvement may include lack of resources and management errors. Audit filters represent a
common method to identify patients with potential opportunities for improvement and to screen
patients for multidisciplinary review but it is currently unknown how well individual audit filters
predict opportunities for improvement.

### Aim

To assess the performance of individual audit filters in predicting opportunitites for improvement
in the care of adult trauma patients.

### Methods

This is a registry based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality
database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about
12000 patients treated between 2012 and 2022. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the
trauma registry and includes about 6000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2022. The
outcome is opportunities for improvement, as identified by the multidisciplinary review board and
recorded in the trauma care quality database. Data on the audit fitlers are available in the trauma
registry. This project will link the two databases and assess the performance of each audit filter in
terms of discrimination and accuracy. A 5% significance level and 95% confidence levels will be
used.
